# Personal Project

This Typescript application is a personal project designed to serve as an online portfolio, showcasing a few skills I've developed through my career as a full-stack
software engineer and through learning outside of work.

### Motivation
I started this project to learn more about how React applications work while teaching myself TypeScript.  I had never built a React application by myself without using `create-react-app`, so it was important to me that I understood the role played by every single line of code.

Originally, this was only meant to be a weather app that utilized the DarkSky API.  After finishing the Weather app, I decided to make this project into a full personal website.  Currently, the only real additions are the Sidebar and introduction of Routing.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to TypeScriptApp folder
3. Install packages

```bash
npm install
```
4. Serve with WebPack
```bash
npm start
```

## Planned Changes
1.  Create Express.js backend to handle API requests.
2.  Create Home screen to serve as a landing page for my portfolio.
3.  Host website on dedicated domain once Home page is complete.
4.  Add additional mini projects to showcase alongside the Weather portion.
